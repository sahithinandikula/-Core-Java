//caja whre we need to create one user defined package .It contains one abstract class having one undefined,defined methods and a paramaterized constructor and we have separate base class and we have on interface which contains one defined,undefined,one static...   Then provide functionality for all the abstract methods in a concreate class in separate class and invoke them by providing dynamic inputs.

package P1
public abstract class A
{
   int m1(char ch);
   String m2(int a);
   A(float f);
}
p1.p2
